Your post-apocalyptic visualization of Dublin City can take any form you like, but the project must
have the following basic functionality:
1. 3-dimensional objects and views (note: fixed top-down orthographic view not allowed).
2. User interaction and camera-control
o user should be able to move around the scene using the keyboard and/or the 
mouse. At a minimum, implement moving forwards and backwards, turning left 
and turning right;
3. A Hierarchical animated Zombie/Robot etc. character or object relevant to the theme;
4. A crowd of moving Zombies/Robots etc.. characters or objects relevant to the theme;
o The crowd can be implemented in any way that you like. At a minimum, the 
crowd members should be translating around the scene, e.g., forwards and 
backwards. (A crowd simulation algorithm such as boids can be implemented as 
an Advanced Feature and having a hierarchical character for each crowd 
member is also an Advanced Feature).
5. Texture-mapping your scene and creatures using image files (e.g., jpg);
6. Implementation of the Phong Illumination model. Specular highlights must be visible;
o Multiple light sources (at least 2, can be point, directional, or spotlight)
o Multiple different material properties (at least 5 on 5 different objects – e.g., 
you could have several crowd characters with different material properties)
o Normal must be transformed correctly
o Shading must use a combination of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting

Advanced Features can include the following, or indeed others that you think of:
• More complex boids/crowd animation
• Hierarchical creatures that move realistically in your crowd
• Simulated dynamics or physics of any sort
• Intelligent Characters 
• Great models that you made yourself
• Height-mapped terrain
• Procedurally generated terrain or meshes
• More advanced texturing effects; multi-texturing, environment-mapping, bumpmapping, specular-mapping, etc.
• ??? – your own feature ideas
